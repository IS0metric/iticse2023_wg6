COMPUTER SCIENCE INTO SCHOOLS<h2>summary</h2>
			<li>To develop a range of key skills in the student and to offer an early taste of teaching to those interested in pursuing it as a career or for other career pathways where public understanding of science is required.</li>
			<li>To help students gain confidence in communicating Computer Science, develop strong organisational and interpersonal skills, and understand how to address the needs of individuals.</li>
			<li>To learn to devise and develop Computer Science projects and teaching methods appropriate to engage the relevant age group they are working with.</li>
			<li>To help inspire a new generation of Computer Scientists as prospective undergraduates by providing role models for school pupils.</li>
			<li>To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Computer Science.</li>
			<li>To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.</li>
		<h2>content</h2>
			<li>A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.  </li>
			<li>One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.  </li>
			<li>Series of lectures on key transferable skills.  </li>
			<li>The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.  </li>
			<li>Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.  </li>
			<li>The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:  </li>
			<li>Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.  </li>
			<li>Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term. This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class. The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.  </li>
			<li>Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.  </li>
			<li>University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.  </li>
			<li>Special projects: The student will devise a special Computer Science project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with. The student will implement the special project and evaluate it. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.  </li>
			<li>Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils. The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.  </li>
			<li>Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.  </li>
			<li>The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach and Engagement Team whenever necessary.</li>

Patterns (analysis, design, architecture...) are one of the innovations that have had the greatest impact in object-oriented development in recent years, along with the appearance of the UML language. Their main advantage is that they save time and improve quality by applying solutions (which we call patterns) that have already been widely tested by other designers.

For this reason, the use of patterns is considered a basic skill that object-oriented software designers must acquire today. Now, it does not seem that this ability can be acquired in any other way than through practice; In this practice, the detailed information found in books -which are already beginning to be numerous- about patterns is usually used, and this way of working is the one that is recommended to students for their future professional work.

UOC_Spain,5.587,"<h2>title</h2>Software engineering of components and distributed systems<h2>summary</h2>Ongoing advances in computing and telecommunications are changing the way software is developed. In particular, the relentless increase in the power of personal computers and mobile devices, the lowering of hardware costs, and the appearance of global coverage data networks have made possible an infrastructure that is especially conducive to the use of open and distributed systems. 

These changes have caused, among other things, that the traditional methods of software design and development (seen in the subjects of Engineering and Software Analysis and design with patterns) are insufficient, since, more or less implicitly, they assume that The application to be developed will be executed in a basically centralized environment. Therefore, traditional methods are unable to naturally manage the complexity of the requirements of this new type of systems. On the other hand, the aspects closest to the analysis and specification of requirements studied in the Requirements Engineering subject do not change with respect to what was seen in previous courses and, therefore, are not repeated here.

This subject serves as an introduction to software architectures as a framework for the design and development of distributed applications where the fundamentals, techniques and skills applicable to the modern definition of software architectures are studied and put into practice and knowledge is complemented. acquired in previous courses. The design of the architecture of software systems makes it possible to describe in an abstract and high-level way both the functionality of the system and many other non-functional aspects of it (distribution, reliability, security, adaptability, benefits, etc.). This system description is often defined by an architectural style, a classification of software systems into large families that follow a common structural pattern. Among the most common architectural styles for distributed systems are systems organized into microservices, multiple layers, client-server systems, or peer-to-peer systems.

Application design in terms of software microservices must be further refined to accommodate and implement it on a particular distributed software technology. These architectures can be implemented using any programming paradigm (object-oriented, structured...). In our specific case, the reference language will be Java, which allows the development of distributed applications with microservices architectures. These microservices are the ones that will be used to implement and test the architectural elements described in the system architecture.

Finally, some good practices in the development and production of software in distributed architectures are collected. Some of the key concepts are worked on when developing and putting into production, such as continuous delivery, DevOps culture, and deployment with containers.

UOC_Spain,5.6,"<h2>title</h2>Planning and strategic use of IS<h2>summary</h2>The mission of this course is to introduce students of Computer Engineering and other careers to the basics to understand the strategic uses of technology in organizations and the management and strategic planning of information systems. In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.

This is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.

Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).

The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.

This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:

What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?
How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?
How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?
What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?
How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?
How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?
How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?

Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.",Planning and strategic use of IS,"The mission of this course is to introduce students of Computer Engineering and other careers to the basics to understand the strategic uses of technology in organizations and the management and strategic planning of information systems.

The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.

Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).

The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.

This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:

What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?
How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?
How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?
What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?
How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?
How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?
How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?

Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.",,
UOC_Spain,5.601,"<h2>title</h2>Cryptography<h2>summary</h2>The main objective of the Cryptography course is to train students in the field of modern cryptography. This discipline is increasingly important in the world we live in due to the increasing value of information. On the one hand, cryptographic techniques are necessary to protect the security and privacy of users when using technology and communication networks. In particular, it is important to protect users from mass surveillance activities that can be carried out illegally not only by private companies but also by some government agencies operating outside of legal circuits. On the other hand, beyond the protection of users, companies and any entity that is related to or uses technology needs mechanisms that protect their digital assets, which can sometimes be all the assets of a company. Finally, the development of cryptography also allows the birth of new relationship paradigms between people such as the creation of new virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, which do not depend on any centralized entity to function.

The subject wants to give a practical approach to cryptography, and that is why the subject is structured jointly based on both theoretical and practical content that is complemented by programming activities that allow us to know the real problems that arise in the implementation of cryptographic systems.",Cryptography,"The main objective of the Cryptography course is to train students in the field of modern cryptography.

UOC_Spain,5.604,"<h2>title</h2>Electronic commerce<h2>summary</h2>The Electronic Commerce subject aims to train students in this new discipline born as a result of widely used communication networks, such as the Internet. Despite the wide range of disciplines that are often included in the words ""e-commerce"" (new economics, marketing, law, social behavior, etc.), it is important to note that since we are dealing with a computer engineering subject, its approach is eminently technological. In any case, the fact that its focus is technological does not mean that it includes different disciplines within this aspect. Thus, we can identify three large areas of knowledge that we will focus on in this course.

On the one hand we find the databases. In electronic commerce systems, the correct design and management of databases is extremely important since one of the characteristics of electronic commerce is its high degree of automation, more than in other areas. This makes databases play a very important role.

Another relevant point in electronic commerce is presented by payment systems. As is well known, one of the reluctances that electronic commerce must overcome is distrust and therefore special emphasis must be placed on security.

Finally, there is a part that is often forgotten, perhaps because it affects us little, or rather, it affects us positively, and that is the problem presented by electronic commerce of digital products. The ease of copying together with the precision of these implies that piracy becomes an inherent problem with this support. This problem, which often slows down the sale and distribution of products through electronic commerce, currently generates significant research efforts. We will see different possibilities to end piracy and what problems they present.

The subject wants to be taught with a very practical approach, and that is why two compulsory practices have been included in the subject, in addition to the four PEC. In the first practice we will work with the basic web development technologies to launch an electronic commerce. On the other hand, in the second practice we will implement an electronic commerce system through a specialized content management tool (CMS) for electronic commerce: Prestashop.",Electronic commerce,"The Electronic Commerce subject aims to train students in this new discipline born as a result of widely used communication networks, such as the Internet.
