Course,Title,Description,Outcomes
05.574,Computer networks security,"This course presents the problem of security in computer networks, and more specifically in TCP/IP networks.

The structure of this course follows the following model. First, the problem of security in TCP/IP networks is presented. Once we have seen the possible security problems in this type of network, we will focus on the prevention mechanisms that exist, based mainly on information filtering. Subsequently, and assuming that not all TCP/IP network prevention and protection systems are infallible, we will study the different intrusion detection mechanisms that exist. Finally we will highlight the specific protection techniques that exist. Specifically, we will introduce the basic notions of cryptography that will allow us to understand the operation of different mechanisms and applications that allow us to protect ourselves against attacks.

The focus of this course assumes that the student already has basic knowledge about the operation of TCP/IP networks and the Unix work environment. Its orientation is eminently practical and implies that the student must dedicate an effort to the installation and configuration of the software, as part of the evaluable objectives of the subject.",
05.576,Computer networks design,"Today, large networks are a fundamental part of our environment, mainly thanks to the Internet phenomenon and the proliferation of broadband. From email or instant messaging to web services, networks are one more aspect of our lives, always present invisibly, but now unavoidable. For this reason, new specialists are needed every day to support companies that want to get the most out of their networks and use remote interconnection technologies to make the distance that separates them disappear completely. This need has also created a set of professional certifications attesting to their expertise.

The ""Design of Computer Networks"" (DRC) course uses the basics of network design as a narrative thread to train students in two important aspects of network deployment in multi-branch organizations. On the one hand, the creation of redundant and scalable local area networks (LAN), and on the other hand, the basic mechanisms to achieve connectivity through different WAN technologies (Wide Area Network, Wide Area Networks).

Its main particularity compared to other degree subjects is that its content is fully aligned with part of the latest version of the official Cisco syllabus for obtaining the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) professional certification, in Spanish. This is one of the most recognized in the world of professional networks and serves as an entry point for a number of specializations in the field (design, security, etc.).

Specifically, within the entire agenda of this latest version of the CCNA agenda, called ""CCNA Routing & Switching"", the first module corresponds to a small part of the ""Scaling Networks"" curriculum and the rest with practically all of ""Connecting networks”. "".",
05.577,Operating systems design,"Once we have seen the functionalities that the Operating System (OS) offers to users, we are in a position to analyze the different techniques and policies that make them possible. This knowledge has to allow us a better use of the operating system as end users, and provides the bases to be able to carry out a correct administration of the Operating System.

This subject will present what an Operating System is, from an internal point of view. The different possibilities of managing the elements of the OS, both hardware and software, will be seen.

To achieve these objectives, theoretical and practical concepts are combined. In the practical part, the source code of the Linux operating system will be studied and modified.",
05.578,Computers architecture,"In this subject, the knowledge of computer architecture introduced in the Fundamentals and Structure of Computers of the Degree in Computer Engineering is deepened.

The course delves into advanced concepts of computer structure: computer performance and processor pipeline. In addition, an introduction is made to the differentiating elements of multiprocessors, and their different architectures.

The course has a strong practical component. The first part of the lab (Practice 1) is done using CPU architecture simulators (such as the WINDLX simulator in the Windows environment). The second part of the laboratory (Practice 2) deals with basic parallel programming issues.",
05.579,Automata and grammars,"A very important part of the information available today is available in textual format: web pages, configuration files, scripts, computer programs or even natural language text. For a computer to be able to use this information, it needs to be able to interpret it according to the rules of the language in which it is written.

In this subject, basic techniques are presented to describe the structure of a language, regular expressions and context-free grammars. These notations are used, for example, to describe programming languages ​​or describe text patterns for searching.

In addition, the mechanisms used by computers to recognize if a sentence is correctly formed according to the structure of a language are presented. Specifically, finite automata and stacked automata are presented.

In summary, this subject provides the basic tools to know how to handle textual information with a computer.",
05.580,Compilers,"Compilers are essential tools for any computer scientist, responsible for translating textual information from one format or language to another. For example, they act as key players in the execution process of a program: they translate the program from the high-level language used by humans into a low-level language that can be executed on a computer (such as assembler or machine code).

This course introduces the basic structure of a compiler: the modules that make it up and how they communicate with each other. We will focus on the case of general purpose programming languages ​​and on the process of generating an executable from a high level program.

Specifically, we will see how a source program is analyzed to obtain its components and possible errors introduced by the programmer are detected. The concept of interpreter and its relationship with compilers will also be introduced. Subsequently, it will be studied how the object code is generated and optimized from the data obtained in the analysis part to improve performance. All of this will be implemented by using compiler build tools.",
05.581,Knowledge representation,"Intelligent systems need to use information in their decision making process. Not only the ability to store and query information is required, functionalities that can be achieved through databases or in-memory data structures. In addition to this, it is necessary to be able to relate the information and use it as a base from which to infer new knowledge.

This course presents the most common representation schemes to represent knowledge in intelligent systems: ontologies, semantic networks, logical representations, frameworks, etc. It also presents fields of application where these schemes are used, such as the field of the semantic web.",
05.583,Machine learning,"The main motivation of this course is to make machine learning known and how it is situated within Artificial Intelligence as a discipline and to understand what agents and multi-agent systems are.

In Artificial Intelligence an overview of Artificial Intelligence was given and some of the so-called classical methods and techniques were presented, such as problem solving, search and knowledge-based systems, approximate reasoning techniques were also seen more advanced. .

In this course, you will go much deeper into the problem of machine learning (machine learning), covering the topics of unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (classification) learning. In particular, emphasis will be placed on the most advanced algorithms, such as support vector machines, classifier sets or neural networks.",
05.584,Data mining,"Data is the new oil. Therefore, Data Mining is a subject to apply the previous knowledge acquired to Statistics and Databases and present some new ones more specific to the field of knowledge extraction. A set of methods from Artificial Intelligence are presented, which form the essential core of the discipline known as Data Mining. The basic concepts of the mentioned subjects are very useful in this matter and will allow a better evaluation of some of the techniques that will be studied.",
05.586,Analysis and design with patterns,"This course is focused on the study of analysis and design patterns contemplated from a practical perspective. The contents are located within the object-oriented methodology, the most currently accepted, and using the UML notation for the same reason.

Patterns (analysis, design, architecture...) are one of the innovations that have had the greatest impact in object-oriented development in recent years, along with the appearance of the UML language. Their main advantage is that they save time and improve quality by applying solutions (which we call patterns) that have already been widely tested by other designers.

For this reason, the use of patterns is considered a basic skill that object-oriented software designers must acquire today. Now, it does not seem that this ability can be acquired in any other way than through practice; In this practice, the detailed information found in books -which are already beginning to be numerous- about patterns is usually used, and this way of working is the one that is recommended to students for their future professional work.

This course provides summary descriptions of many of the most popular and currently accepted patterns, as well as some general concepts about patterns and their usage.",
05.587,Software engineering of components and distributed systems,"Ongoing advances in computing and telecommunications are changing the way software is developed. In particular, the relentless increase in the power of personal computers and mobile devices, the lowering of hardware costs, and the appearance of global coverage data networks have made possible an infrastructure that is especially conducive to the use of open and distributed systems. 

These changes have caused, among other things, that the traditional methods of software design and development (seen in the subjects of Engineering and Software Analysis and design with patterns) are insufficient, since, more or less implicitly, they assume that The application to be developed will be executed in a basically centralized environment. Therefore, traditional methods are unable to naturally manage the complexity of the requirements of this new type of systems. On the other hand, the aspects closest to the analysis and specification of requirements studied in the Requirements Engineering subject do not change with respect to what was seen in previous courses and, therefore, are not repeated here.

This subject serves as an introduction to software architectures as a framework for the design and development of distributed applications where the fundamentals, techniques and skills applicable to the modern definition of software architectures are studied and put into practice and knowledge is complemented. acquired in previous courses. The design of the architecture of software systems makes it possible to describe in an abstract and high-level way both the functionality of the system and many other non-functional aspects of it (distribution, reliability, security, adaptability, benefits, etc.). This system description is often defined by an architectural style, a classification of software systems into large families that follow a common structural pattern. Among the most common architectural styles for distributed systems are systems organized into microservices, multiple layers, client-server systems, or peer-to-peer systems.

Application design in terms of software microservices must be further refined to accommodate and implement it on a particular distributed software technology. These architectures can be implemented using any programming paradigm (object-oriented, structured...). In our specific case, the reference language will be Java, which allows the development of distributed applications with microservices architectures. These microservices are the ones that will be used to implement and test the architectural elements described in the system architecture.

Finally, some good practices in the development and production of software in distributed architectures are collected. Some of the key concepts are worked on when developing and putting into production, such as continuous delivery, DevOps culture, and deployment with containers.
",
05.588,Software developement project,"The Software Development Project course has as its main objective the development of a specific software project and is based on the practical application of the knowledge and skills obtained so far in the Degree, such as Project Management, Fundamentals of Programming, Engineering of Software, Use of Databases, and specifically the technical skills that were obtained within Software Engineering of Components and Distributed Systems.

Despite the fact that the subject is based on carrying out a specific software project, the subject also covers both new theoretical aspects and others that complement the knowledge acquired up to now, such as agile software development methodologies.

The effective development of the project will be achieved through a specific agile methodology (Scrum) that iteratively covers in the form of sprints all the stages of the software life cycle, that is, the specification, design, implementation, testing, deployment and delivery of the project. product to the ""supposed"" customer. In particular, in the implementation stage, Java will be used to develop the distributed software based on a microserver architecture. In addition, other technologies will support the project, such as configuration, design, testing, continuous delivery, and containerized deployment tools. All these technologies have been seen and practiced in the previous subject of Software Engineering of Distributed Components and Systems and therefore it is assumed that the students know them.

Finally, the complexity of the project will require the specific development of skills related to collaborative work in small groups of students. The UOC will offer students a collaborative space where they can carry out communication between group members, share documentation and, in general, manage the project, with the support and supervision of the subject advisors.",
05.591,Computer networks structure,"Today, large networks are a fundamental part of our environment, mainly thanks to the Internet phenomenon and the proliferation of broadband. From email or instant messaging to web services, networks are one more aspect of our lives, always present invisibly, but now unavoidable. For this reason, new specialists are needed every day to support companies that want to get the most out of their networks and use remote interconnection technologies to make the distance that separates them disappear completely. This need has also created a set of professional certifications attesting to their expertise.

The course ""Computer Network Structure"" (ERC) focuses on learning the fundamentals of the lowest level communication protocols that allow different types of devices to communicate: Transport, Internet and Network Access. Within this, special prominence is given to the operation of Ethernet local area networks (LAN) and the creation of IP addressing schemes.

Its main particularity compared to other degree subjects is that its content is fully aligned with part of the latest version of the official Cisco syllabus for obtaining the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) professional certification, in Spanish. This is one of the most recognized in the professional world of networks and serves as an entry point for a whole set of specializations in the field (design, security, etc.).

Specifically, within the entire agenda of this latest version of the CCNA agenda, this course encompasses practically the entire first part of the course, called ""Introduction to Networks"" (ITN), and a part of the second, called ""Switching , Routing and Wireless Fundamentals"" (SRWE).",
05.592,Advanced computers architecture,"In this subject, knowledge of the advanced architectures of current computers is deepened. On the one hand, previous knowledge in Fundamentals and Structure of Computers and Computer Architecture will be expanded. On the other hand, different models of current processor architectures will be presented. Among them, high performance architectures, multicores or GPU architectures will be studied.

However, not only the purely architectural aspects of these systems will be discussed, but the different programming paradigms associated with these architectures will also be presented.",
05.593,Requirements engineering,"Requirements engineering is the discipline that helps us to identify, manage and maintain the set of software requirements that we want to develop. Requirements engineering takes place in the same context as software engineering (software development), so it can be seen as part of software engineering. Even so, it must be taken into account that requirements engineering requires knowledge and skills from other disciplines such as psychology, marketing or design.

The purpose of this course is for future software engineers to deepen their study of the problems, techniques, and tools related to obtaining, managing, documenting, and validating/verifying the requirements of a software system. When presenting the contents of this course, we have set ourselves two main objectives:

1) The discipline of requirements engineering is presented from a practical point of view, giving great importance to the techniques and tools that students will be able to apply in their professional lives.
2) The broadest possible vision of requirements engineering is also given, looking at aspects as diverse as product management or the implementation of automated acceptance tests.

This subject assumes that the student has basic notions of requirements engineering (in the case of UOC students, it will be assumed that they have taken the Software Engineering subject). Therefore, this course deepens and extends some concepts that have already been studied before, at the same time that it introduces new techniques and tools of requirements engineering.",
05.594,Embedded systems,"Embedded systems are increasingly present in our lives. From network devices to industrial control systems, a wide range of devices make up what we know as an Embedded System. In this topic we want to give an overview of these systems. We will start from its definition and delve into its fields of application. The knowledge of the hardware components that constitute these systems will be deepened, we will know their programming models and the particularities that condition the development of applications for embedded systems.

The main objective of the course is for the student to learn the basic programming techniques of an embedded system, have a basic knowledge of the hardware architecture that composes them and acquire skills to work with this type of device.",
05.595,Enterpreneurship,"New business opportunities appear every day to respond to previously non-existent or unsatisfied needs or to improve the existing offer. In addition, organizations increasingly value having an entrepreneurial organizational culture and encourage people who work to act as entrepreneurs in the same organization. And it has been shown that there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurship and the development of a country or region. Among other characteristics, it contributes to economic growth, is a source of innovation, favors job creation and contributes to social cohesion and dynamism.

In this sense, the Entrepreneurial Initiative subject aims to promote the entrepreneurial spirit of students from the introduction to the main elements that make up the entrepreneurial process from an applied and practical approach. Firstly, we will introduce ourselves to the entrepreneurial phenomenon, analyzing various typologies and taking into account the gender perspective. Next, we will immerse ourselves in the ideation, validation, modeling and presentation of a viable and sustainable entrepreneurial project (following the sustainable development objectives) developing our capacities for initiative, innovation and teamwork.",
05.596,Foundations of information systems,"The continuous innovations in information and communication technologies are transforming the corporate business world into new models, new processes and new business needs. This environment has favored the investments of the companies to be more competitive in the current market, allocating a budget to the acquisition, implementation or updating of information systems.

In this topic we present the basic concepts of information systems, the types of information systems, the relevance of information systems for companies, what the first information systems were like, how they have evolved and what the systems of the system have to contribute. future. In companies

We will know the main information system: Enterprise Resource Planning, today also known as basic or traditional.

We will see how the incorporation of new functionalities in the evolution of ERP systems gives rise to new collaborative information systems: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supplier Chain Management (SCM) or Business Intelligence (BI).

And a transversal theme to any company information system, its implementation. We will cover the life cycle of an implementation project, the characteristics of its different phases, the problems and what guidelines to follow to obtain a successful implementation.",
05.597,Information systems integration,"The contents of the subject ""Information Systems Integration"" (ISI) revolve around the various meanings of the word ""integration"" in relation to organizations of all kinds, and the information systems they use. Thus, to begin with, we will see the type of problems that usually arise in organizations with little structural integration, as well as the proposals that contribute to a better business integration, mainly the definition and implementation of business processes, transversal to the classic functional ones. areas

Subsequently, it will be seen how organizations have been developing and implementing new information systems as a fundamental tool for their structural and informational integration, and as a means for their progress in terms of their functional management and strategic direction, in short, for their progress. in terms of quality and competitiveness.

In this line, the different integrating roles that companies pursue through the main types of business information systems implemented in recent years, from ERP systems to BI systems, through CRM and SCM systems, through for EAI projects. Finally, some of the concepts related to the implementation of information systems in organizations will be introduced from a very practical point of view.",
05.598,Use of information systems in organizations,"The subject Use of Information Systems in Organizations (USIO) has a deductive approach; that is, through the study and work of cases, the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in organizations is analyzed. This approach allows establishing conclusions and interpretations whose purpose is to understand the efficient use of ICT in management and business decision making.

The course is based on solving a case throughout the semester by working in interdisciplinary groups. The students of the Degrees in Computer Engineering (GII) and Business Administration and Management (ADE) will share a work space in which they will develop the activities of the subject. This point is very important and the student should consider it before enrolling. Unlike other subjects where there is detailed material to work on for further assessment, the USIO does not have material that the student must study in the classical sense. A group must be formed and work must be done on the approach of a case with contents of business information systems. The development must be collaborative and although some recommended readings are given, searches on the Internet or other sources must also be carried out, proposing a coherent and argued solution. It is not possible to think that there is ""the solution"" in the style of a mathematical exercise, there are several possible ones and the consultant will evaluate the different alternatives with pre-established criteria (indicated as part of the statement). Group work dynamics are usually complex and in this sense it is very important to form a cohesive group that is willing to work from the beginning.",
05.599,Functional management of IS/IT services,"This subject presents an environment that guarantees the support of IS/IT services and infrastructure in the organization, for the achievement of corporate strategies and objectives. It treats the management of IS/IT services as a set of processes and functions, provided or managed from an IT department. There are references that are useful guides in the management of these services such as ITIL, COBIT, CMMi.",
05.600,Planning and strategic use of IS,"The mission of this course is to introduce students of Computer Engineering and other careers to the basics to understand the strategic uses of technology in organizations and the management and strategic planning of information systems. In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.

This is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.

Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).

The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.

This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:

What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?
How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?
How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?
What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?
How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?
How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?
How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?

Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.",
05.601,Cryptography,"The main objective of the Cryptography course is to train students in the field of modern cryptography. This discipline is increasingly important in the world we live in due to the increasing value of information. On the one hand, cryptographic techniques are necessary to protect the security and privacy of users when using technology and communication networks. In particular, it is important to protect users from mass surveillance activities that can be carried out illegally not only by private companies but also by some government agencies operating outside of legal circuits. On the other hand, beyond the protection of users, companies and any entity that is related to or uses technology needs mechanisms that protect their digital assets, which can sometimes be all the assets of a company. Finally, the development of cryptography also allows the birth of new relationship paradigms between people such as the creation of new virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, which do not depend on any centralized entity to function.

The subject wants to give a practical approach to cryptography, and that is why the subject is structured jointly based on both theoretical and practical content that is complemented by programming activities that allow us to know the real problems that arise in the implementation of cryptographic systems.",
05.604,Electronic commerce,"The Electronic Commerce subject aims to train students in this new discipline born as a result of widely used communication networks, such as the Internet. Despite the wide range of disciplines that are often included in the words ""e-commerce"" (new economics, marketing, law, social behavior, etc.), it is important to note that since we are dealing with a computer engineering subject, its approach is eminently technological. In any case, the fact that its focus is technological does not mean that it includes different disciplines within this aspect. Thus, we can identify three large areas of knowledge that we will focus on in this course.

On the one hand we find the databases. In electronic commerce systems, the correct design and management of databases is extremely important since one of the characteristics of electronic commerce is its high degree of automation, more than in other areas. This makes databases play a very important role.

Another relevant point in electronic commerce is presented by payment systems. As is well known, one of the reluctances that electronic commerce must overcome is distrust and therefore special emphasis must be placed on security.

Finally, there is a part that is often forgotten, perhaps because it affects us little, or rather, it affects us positively, and that is the problem presented by electronic commerce of digital products. The ease of copying together with the precision of these implies that piracy becomes an inherent problem with this support. This problem, which often slows down the sale and distribution of products through electronic commerce, currently generates significant research efforts. We will see different possibilities to end piracy and what problems they present.

The subject wants to be taught with a very practical approach, and that is why two compulsory practices have been included in the subject, in addition to the four PEC. In the first practice we will work with the basic web development technologies to launch an electronic commerce. On the other hand, in the second practice we will implement an electronic commerce system through a specialized content management tool (CMS) for electronic commerce: Prestashop.",
05.607,Databases architecture,"Database Architecture is an optional subject, proposed within the Information Technologies itinerary, belonging to the Degree in Computer Engineering. The subject delves into the knowledge acquired in previous compulsory subjects on databases, such as the Use of Databases and Database Design.

The course begins by studying the main drawbacks of the relational model and presents some alternative data models. Next, the main problems related to the implementation of database management systems (DBMS) are analyzed, both in centralized and distributed environments. Finally, fundamental concepts on the design of distributed databases are introduced.

The Degree in Computer Engineering has as a transversal competence to acquire the learning of foreign languages ​​(specifically English). That is why some subjects have the learning material in English. This is the case of Database Architecture, given its specific characteristics (specialization subject with a model based on continuous evaluation).",
05.613,Data structures design,"In this subject the different strategies of data representation in a computer and the criteria to evaluate them are studied. Depending on the type of treatment that has to be done with this information (size, access criteria, etc.), it will be possible to select the strategy that offers an optimal balance between memory consumption and manipulation time.

This course is fundamental within the field of programming, since the proper use of data structures is critical in any application that handles large volumes of information or that has very strict efficiency requirements.

Previous courses in the field of programming have already introduced some basic data structures, such as lists, stacks, queues, or trees. This subject presents the concept of abstract data type (ATD) as a general model to describe a data structure and study its efficiency. Finally, the core of the course consists of learning to use each data structure properly and knowing how to select the most appropriate data structure for each situation.",
05.614,Introduction to mathematics for engineering,"Mastering the contents and mathematical methodology is essential to take any scientific degree. Therefore, it is necessary to understand its basic techniques and concepts (many times already covered in secondary and high school) before addressing the subjects of the career that you want to take.

In this course, the basic techniques and concepts of linear algebra and calculus will be provided, to guarantee adequate preparation to pass many of the subjects of the degree.",
05.672,Business practice,"The objective of the Practices is for the student to learn to work on a day-to-day basis in a company and apply certain skills acquired in the Computer Engineering degree, both transversal and specific. The internships in companies will be organized from the UOC, with a trainee professor, and from the company with a tutor who will guide and monitor the student.

The internships will be carried out mainly online within the framework of the UOC's virtual campus. In some cases, depending on the circumstances of residence and availability of the student, they may have a face-to-face component.

The tools to develop the practices will be mainly those provided by the studies, being able to receive from the company some other specific tool to develop the work. The study load for the student will be 12 ETCS, equivalent to about 300 hours of work in the company.",
22.400,Computational thinking,"This course is designed to prepare us to start in the world of programming, and to know and understand the basic concepts that will allow us to turn a specific problem into a small program that solves it.

In order to do so, we will first learn to think in such a way that we can identify what kinds of problems can be solved using a computer running through a sequence of steps designed to solve the proposed problem. That is, through what is known as computational thinking, we will know the abstract concepts that determine the appropriate reasoning to be able to solve problems through programs.

Next, we'll review programming languages, which have evolved very rapidly since the popularization of personal computers, and we'll also learn about other important elements of programming context and vocabulary, such as what a computer is and what its function is. basic function. .

Finally, we will see how to put it into practice by developing a small program in a guided way, introducing the different concepts that make up what is known as structured programming. To do this, we will use the Processing programming language, which was created with the aim of encouraging creativity and learning to program in a simple and attractive way.",
